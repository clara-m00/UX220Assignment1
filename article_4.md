# Hobbies
I took up some of my old hobbies that I used to do many years ago. One of the hobbies I;m most proud of is that I started drawing again. I used to be so creative but somewhere down the line I feel as though I lost that part of me so it’s nice to come back to old hobbies. I started reading a lot more, and have a huge “to-read” list. Additionally, I started playing the guitar again and became better at it than I used to! I'm still working on learning piano but someday I’ll get there.
