# Wellness
I started going to therapy to improve my mental health since I finally have the means to afford going almost every week. This is something I’ve been struggling with for a long time so I’m glad I’m able to do this now. I also started being more active. I still don’t necessarily enjoy going to the gym, but I go for runs and do yoga at least three times a week.
