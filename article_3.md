After finishing my co-op term in university, I was offered a job working there as a Junior UX Designer full-time. I gladly accepted the role as I was already familiar with the company and the people there. During this time I learned a lot about being a UX Designer, and how to improve my skills as well. Eventually I left this job to go work at a bigger prestigious company, and build new products that would leave a positive impact on society.
